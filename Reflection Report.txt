Reflection Report

The multi-agent approach provided clear advantages over a hypothetical single-agent system by enabling role specialization and structured collaboration. Instead of one agent attempting to interpret the user query, retrieve policies, decide on an action, and generate a response all at once, these responsibilities were divided among multiple agents. This separation reduced cognitive overload and improved clarity, as each agent focused on a specific task such as intent identification, policy reasoning, response formulation, or quality assurance. As a result, the system produced more consistent and reliable outputs.

Another key benefit of the multi-agent design was improved coordination and control through the supervisor agent. The supervisor enforced execution order and ensured that each stage of the workflow was completed before moving to the next. This helped prevent common issues such as infinite loops, premature responses, or missing reasoning steps. Additionally, the inclusion of a quality reviewer agent introduced a human-in-the-loop style safety mechanism, allowing the system to verify responses before final approval. This layer significantly reduced the risk of hallucinations and inappropriate outputs.

Overall, the multi-agent architecture proved more scalable and maintainable than a single-agent alternative. New capabilities can be added by introducing additional agents without disrupting the existing system. While a single agent may be simpler to implement for small tasks, this project demonstrated that multi-agent systems are better suited for complex, real-world scenarios that require coordination, accountability, and structured reasoning.
